## Novice Practices
This is for new programmers to strengthen their debugging skills with little programming involved.

This helps to build a more critical eye when things are not quite right.

### Checks and expectations before starting
- You should be able to know how to use basic Git, such as cloning, pushing, and commiting.
- You should have Ruby installed and your environment setup and know how to execute a Ruby file from your Terminal.
- You should also be somewhat comfortable reading and writing Ruby code but you're still new to programming and reading error messages.
- This has little to no programming involved, you'll need to solve your way through the errors and fix them. Each level increases exponentially in complexity.
