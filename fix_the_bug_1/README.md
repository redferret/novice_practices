### Fix the bug (Novice lvl 1)

Run the ruby file `runner.rb` at the root of this project and find a way to fix the issues.

Hint: After running `runner.rb` start with the tests to see why they are failing. Don't pay attention to ruby suggestions, they can be misleading at times. The Spec file is not broken or wrong in anyway.
